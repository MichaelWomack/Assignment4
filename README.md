# Assignment4

The purpose of this assignment is to reinforce linear data structure concepts.  Specifically, the assigment is to the following 3 problems.

1) Create two linked hash sets {"George", "Jim", "Blake", "Kevin", "Michael"} and {"George", "Katie", "Kevin", "Michelle", "Ryan"} and find their union,
intersection, and difference.  Note that you can clone the sets to preserve the original sets from being changed by these methods.

2) Write a program that reads an unspecified number of integers from a file and finds the integer that has the most occurrences. 
If several numbers have the most occurrences, all of them should be reported.

3) Use these data files to write a program that enables the determination of the ranking of popularity of a name if the year, gender, and name are known. 
To achieve the best efficiency, create two arrays for boy’s names and girl’s names, respectively. Each array has 10 elements for  10 years. Each element 
is a map that stores a name and its ranking in a pair with the name as the key.
